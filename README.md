# Cafeteria

Online Food Ordering System (OFOS) for restaurant with multiple branches.

## Prerequisites

1. Python v2.7
2. pip latest version

## Installing

### Linux (Ubuntu)

1. Use virtual environment for development purpose. Click [here](http://roundhere.net/journal/virtualenv-ubuntu-12-10) to learn how to setup virtual environment.
2. Install pip packages from the home directory of the project in virtual environment.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Further instructions will be added with time.

## General Intructions for Developers

### Do's

1. Figure out the best method (optimal) before implementing and if possible writedown the pros, cons and reason of the method chosen in the documentation.
2. Follow the coding standard as mentioned in standards file.
3. Documentation and commenting is a must.
4. Write down test cases wherever necessary.
5. Review each commit and provide suggestions if required.
6. Try to be quantitative wherever possible (for eg. Server can handle max 100 requests/sec). Capacity/Limitations of each subsystem should be clearly known.
7. Keep updating team and the tasks on all the chosen platforms.
8. Make code as modular as possible but not at the cost of resources(time & space). Choose optimal path as mentioned before.
9. Test the functionality throughly after implementation across different platforms and browsers and cross-check that it doesn't clash with already developed system.
10. Check for license whenever copying code from other sources and if the license has restrictions regarding usage mention it in a separate file (after copying though :P).

### Don'ts

1. Never ever commit to master branch directly. Instead use different branches or pull requests.
2. No hacking in the code to make any functionality work.
3. Don't make the code public at this point of time except for personal use or any course project. NDA. :P
